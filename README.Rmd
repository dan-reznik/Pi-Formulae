### Introduction

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) (1887-1920) is one of history's most gifted Mathematicians, departing at only 33 years of age. In 1917 he discovered several formulas for π. The one below is known as the "[Ramanujan-Sato Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato_series)": 

```{r,echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ramanujan-sato.png")
```

The incredible thing about this formula is its exponential speed of convergence. In turn this places strong requirements on the precision with which large numbers are represented. Below we show the growth of the three large terms in the series, for k=1 to 5:

```{r,echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
library(magrittr)
tibble::tibble(k=1:5,
               `(4k)!`=factorial(4*k),
               `(k!)^4`=factorial(k)^4.,
               `396^(4k)`=396^(4*k)) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "crrr") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F,position="center")
```

Notice that for small k, $396^(4k)$ is the larger term. Suppose k=4. `R` 53-bit doubles can represent up to 22 significant digits:

```{r}
print(396^(4*4),digits=22)
```

Via the arbitrary-precision [Rmpfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/vignettes/Rmpfr-pkg.pdf) package (using 120 bits), we can see the above with its full 42 digits:

```{r}
Rmpfr::mpfr(396, 120)^(4*4)
```

Because total integer precision is imperative for each term in the RS summation, in what follows we will be using the arbitrary-precision library.

### Load the arbitrary-precision library

```{r,message=F}
library(Rmpfr) # use this for arbitrary-precision floats
```

We will be using 120 bits of representation precision:

```{r}
bits <- 120
```

One term of the R-S series and its front coefficient:

```{r}
sqrt2 <- sqrt(mpfr(2L, bits))
rs_coeff <- 9801L/(2L*sqrt2)

rs_term <- function(k) {
  num <- factorial(4L*k)*(26390L*k+1103L)
  den <- (factorial(k)*(396L^k))^4L
  num/den
}
```

Calculates π w/ kmax iterations of the R-S formula:

```{r}
rs_series <- function(kmax) {
  terms <- rs_term(mpfr(0:(kmax-1),bits))
  (rs_coeff/cumsum(terms))
}
```

### Calculate π

Only 5 iterations and we're pretty close:

```{r}
rs_series(5)
```

Error from π computed internally by Rmpfr:

```{r}
rs_series(5)-Const("pi",bits)
```

Mind-blowing convergence of π digits through the Ramanujan-Sato series! `r emo::ji("smile")`

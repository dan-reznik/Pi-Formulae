### Introduction

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) (1887-1920) is one of history's most gifted Mathematicians, sadly departing before he was even 33 years of age.

In 1917 Srinivasa discovered several formulas for π. The one below is known as the "[Ramanujan-Sato Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato_series)": 

```{r,echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ramanujan-sato.png")
```

The incredible thing about this formula is its exponential speed of convergence (the tree large terms simplify to O((99^(-4k)*k^(-3/2)) for large k). In turn, the ratios must be at least the precision we would like to approximate π with. Below we show the growth of the three large terms in the series, and the exponent of their product, for k=1 to 5:

```{r,echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
library(magrittr)
stirlingFactorial <- function(k) sqrt(2*pi*k)*(k/exp(1))^k
stirlingLogFactorial <- function(k) k*log(n)-k+.5*log(2*pi*k)
approx_ratio <- function(k) 0.12698727186848194/(99^(4*k)*k^1.5)
tibble::tibble(k=1:5,
               `t1=(4k)!`=factorial(4*k),
               `t2=(k!)^4`=factorial(k)^4.,
               `t3=396^(4k)`=396^(4*k),
               `O[t1/(t2*t3)]`=log10(approx_ratio(k))%>%round) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "crrr") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F,position="center")
```

Notice that for small k, $396^(4k)$ grows fastest, though above a certain k factorials will take over, k! ~ O(k^k).

53-bit doubles in `R` are limited to 22 significant digits. So for k>2, this term will be truncated. Take k=4 as an example:

```{r}
print(396^(4*4),digits=22)
```

Via the arbitrary-precision [Rmpfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/vignettes/Rmpfr-pkg.pdf) package (using 120 bits), we can see the above with its full 42 digits:

```{r}
Rmpfr::mpfr(396, 120)^(4*4)
```

Total integer precision is imperative in the series computation, so we start by loading the arbitrary-precision library.

### Load the arbitrary-precision library

We will be using 240 bits of precision:

```{r,message=F}
library(dplyr) # to use "%>%" and "tibble"
library(Rmpfr) # use this for arbitrary-precision floats
bits <- 240
```

One term of the R-S series and its front coefficient:

```{r}
sqrt2 <- sqrt(mpfr("2", bits))
rs_coeff <- 9801L/(2L*sqrt2)

rs_term <- function(k) {
  num <- factorial(4L*k)*(26390L*k+1103L)
  den <- (factorial(k)*(396L^k))^4L
  num/den
}
```

Computes π w/ kmax iterations of the R-S formula (reciprocal of original formula):

```{r}
rs_series <- function(kmax) {
  terms <- rs_term(mpfr(0:(kmax-1),bits))
  (rs_coeff/cumsum(terms))
}
```

### Calculate π

Only 5 iterations and we're pretty close:

```{r}
rs_series(5)
```

Obtains high-precision π computed internally by `mpfr` package:

```{r}
piMpfr <- Const("pi",bits)
piMpfr
```

Order of error vs iteration, notice we are expanding the accuracy by 8 digits per iteration:

```{r,echo=F,kable.NA=F}
get_dev_exp <- function(v1,v2) abs(v1-v2) %>% log10 %>% round %>% asNumeric()
tibble(iter=1:5,
       error=get_dev_exp(rs_series(5),piMpfr),
       newDigits=lag(error)-error) %>%
  #purrr::set_names("iter","$|\\pi_{rs}-\\pi_{mpfr}|$","new digits") %>%
  knitr::kable(escape=F)
```

Mind-blowing convergence to the value of π afforded by the Ramanujan-Sato series! `r emo::ji("smile")`

### Introduction

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) (1887-1920) is one of history's most gifted Mathematicians, departing at only 33 years of age. In 1917 he discovered several formulas for π. The one below is known as the "[Ramanujan-Sato Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato_series)": 

```{r,echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ramanujan-sato.png")
```

The incredible thing about this formula is its exponential speed of convergence. In turn this places strong requirements on the precision with which large numbers are represented. Below we show the growth of the three large terms in the series, for k=1 to 5:

```{r,message=F}
library(dplyr)
```


```{r,echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
tibble::tibble(k=1:5,
               `(4k)!`=factorial(4*k),
               `(k!)^4`=factorial(k)^4.,
               `396^(4k)`=396^(4*k)) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "crrr") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F,position="center")
```

Notice that for small k, $396^(4k)$ grows fastest, though above a certain k factorials will take over, k! ~ O(k^k).

53-bit doubles in `R` are limited to 22 significant digits. So for k>2, this term will be truncated. Take k=4 as an example:

```{r}
print(396^(4*4),digits=22)
```

Via the arbitrary-precision [Rmpfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/vignettes/Rmpfr-pkg.pdf) package (using 120 bits), we can see the above with its full 42 digits:

```{r}
Rmpfr::mpfr(396, 120)^(4*4)
```

Total integer precision is imperative in the series computation, so we start by loading the arbitrary-precision library.

### Load the arbitrary-precision library

We will be using 240 bits of precision:

```{r,message=F}
library(Rmpfr) # use this for arbitrary-precision floats
bits <- 240
```

One term of the R-S series and its front coefficient:

```{r}
sqrt2 <- sqrt(mpfr("2", bits))
rs_coeff <- 9801L/(2L*sqrt2)

rs_term <- function(k) {
  num <- factorial(4L*k)*(26390L*k+1103L)
  den <- (factorial(k)*(396L^k))^4L
  num/den
}
```

Calculates π w/ kmax iterations of the R-S formula:

```{r}
rs_series <- function(kmax) {
  terms <- rs_term(mpfr(0:(kmax-1),bits))
  (rs_coeff/cumsum(terms))
}
```

### Calculate π

Only 5 iterations and we're pretty close:

```{r}
rs_series(5)
```

Computes π with Mpfr

```{r}
piMpfr <- Const("pi",bits)
piMpfr
```

In only 5 iterations, deviation is of the order of 10^-39:

```{r}
get_dev_exp <- function(v1,v2) abs(v1-v2) %>% log10 %>% round %>% asNumeric()
tibble(iter=1:5,
       dev=get_dev_exp(rs_series(5),piMpfr)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Mind-blowing convergence to the value of π afforded by the Ramanujan-Sato series! `r emo::ji("smile")`
